    <p>Hello!</p>
    <p>Upcoming enhancements will improve security and ease of use logging into National Manufacturing Group's Sage X3 business system. While these changes aren't quite ready, your username and temporary password are already created. Your full username is <b>{{userPrincipalName}}</b> and your temporary password is <b>{{temporaryPassword}}</b></p>
    <p>Please keep this information handy. We'll send another email in the near future, once the changes are ready with instructions on how to use these new credentials.</p>
    <p>Thank you!</p>
    <p>John O'Neill Sr.<br>National Manufacturing Group</p>
